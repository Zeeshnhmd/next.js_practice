## Export a Static Website

First, we need to change the `package.json` file.

```bash
	"build": "next build && next export"
```

and run the following comand

```bash
npm run build
```

This will build an `out` folder in the root directory
now we need to install the serve package globally

```bash
npm i -g serve
```

Now, in order to see the Static website locally we need to run the following command

```bash
server -s out -p 8000
```

here -p 8000 indicates at which port we need to run the site

For more info we can check the [documentation] (https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/static-html-export)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
